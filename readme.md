## Introduction:
This week we will start our own project. We chose to create a game distribution platform. The idea is game developers can store games on the backend and gamers can download the games to test them and give feedback to update de games.

## Project:
We have created user stories to help us in the project. The idea is to create a webclient and a desktopclient and add our own games. We will use laravel for the webclient and the back-end, and C# for the desktopclient and the games. The scope of this project for us is to show what we have learned over the course of the bootcamp with regards to web development and start learning C#.

## Approach

The plan is to have a working web client in the first week, and a desktop client after the third. To accomplish this we have divided the user stories and worked them out. The exact descriptions of the user stories are on our trelloboard, the link is on the top of this readme.

## Result

We created a Web Client which includes:
  - Login function, with registration
  - Store page with search options
  - upload and download options for games

We also have created a Desktop Client that shows:
  - The Welcome screen 
  - The store page 
  - The Game information

These 2 clients are connected via a separate backend. One of the hardest tasks was to create a login system that would function with the seperate backend.

In addition we have created 5 functional games.
