## Introduction:
This week we will start our own project. We chose to create a game distribution platform. The idea is game developers can store games on the backend and gamers can download the games to test them and give feedback to update de games.

## Project:
We have created user stories to help us in the project. The idea is to create a webclient and a desktopclient and add our own games. We will use laravel for the webclient and the back-end, and C# for the desktopclient and the games.

The following userstories are planned for week 9:
- W9-001  - As a platform owner I want a login system so that there is a secure environment.
- W9-002  - As a developer I want to be able to add games so my games can be judged.
- W9-003  - As a gamer I want to be able to download games so I try them out and judge them.
- W9-004  - As a gamer I want a search function to be able to find new and interesting games.
- W9-005  - As a developer I want an information page for games so I can keep track of the latest developments in my game.
- W9-006  - As a platform owner I want a welcome page with specific games so that new games get enough attention.
- W9-007  - As a gamer I want to be able to give feedback on games so they can be improved.

The scope of this project for us is to learn C#.

The following userstories are planned for week 10 and week 11:

- W10-001  - As a platform owner I want a login system so that there is a secure environment.
- W10-002  - As a developer I want to be able to add games so my games can be judged.
- W10-003  - As a gamer I want to be able to download games so I try them out and judge them.
- W10-004  - As a gamer I want a search function to be able to find new and interesting games.
- W10-005  - As a developer I want an information page for games so I can keep track of the latest developments in my game.
- W10-006  - As a platform owner I want a welcome page with specific games so that new games get enough attention.
- W10-007  - As a gamer I want to be able to give feedback on games so they can be improved.
- W10-008  - As a platform owner I want a minimum of 2 games so there can be some testing.

We assume this will take te most of our time and might not be able to make the following user stories, but just incase we will add them here.

The following userstories are planned for week 12:
- W12-001  - As a platform owner I want a payment option for the download of games so I can cover the costs of the platform.
- W12-002  - As a developer I want options for multiplayer games so I can develop games that can be played by multiple people.


## Approach

The plan is to have a working web client in the first week, and a desktop client after the third. To accomplish this we have divided the user stories and worked them out. The exact descriptions of the user stories are on our trelloboard, the link is on the top of this readme.
